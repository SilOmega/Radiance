# Radiance

A vertical slice where you play as Clarus, a human with an unknown past which is trying to escape from space station invaded by dark creatures. Be mindful of the time of bad things could happen. This project was developed by a small multidisciplinary team as part of my MSc Video Game Developer course at Birmingham City University. The classes provided are my personal contribution to the project.
